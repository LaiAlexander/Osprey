**Project Osprey** is a personal project to learn javascript. It is an incremental browser game, inspired by CookieClicker and several other incremental games.
There is almost no styling yet, as of now this is mostly a proof of concept. Project Osprey is a temporary name.

The game is available at http://laialexander.github.io/Osprey
